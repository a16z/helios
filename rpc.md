# Helios Remote Procedure Calls

Helios provides a variety of RPC methods for interacting with the Ethereum network. These methods are exposed via the `Client` struct.  The RPC methods follow the [Ethereum JSON RPC Spec](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation). See [examples](./examples/readme.rs) of running remote procedure calls with Helios.
