//! # Ethereum light client written in Rust.
//!
//! > Helios is a fully trustless, efficient, and portable Ethereum light client written in Rust.
//!
//! Helios converts an untrusted centralized RPC endpoint into a safe unmanipulable local RPC for its users. It syncs in seconds, requires no storage, and is lightweight enough to run on mobile devices.
//!
//! The entire size of Helios's binary is 13Mb and compiles into WebAssembly. This makes it a perfect target to embed directly inside wallets and dapps.
//!
//! Examples on how you can use helios can be found in the [`examples` directory of the repository](https://github.com/a16z/helios/tree/master/examples) and in the `tests/` directories of each crate.
//!
